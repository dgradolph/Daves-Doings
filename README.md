My code snippets
Hi,
My name is David Gradolph I am 89 years old and live in Palm Beach Gardens FL, I have been writting code since 1969 when I bought a PDP 8 from Dec. I started with Fortran and have written in more languages than I can remember. Most of what I do now is VBA code in big Excel workbooks I use to manage my investments.
